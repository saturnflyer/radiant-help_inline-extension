The Help Inline extension provides documentation within the user interface.

Each user may turn on or off the help tips in their preferences. 
Some details may appear only to users in certain roles.

Help Inline will piggyback on Help (if it is installed) by using it's 
helper methods to hide or show content based on role. If Help is not
installed, the role based content will not be shown.

If you would like to turn off the inline help for all users, you must
uninstall Help Inline.
