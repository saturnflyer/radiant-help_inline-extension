= Help Inline

Help Inline provides a new setting for every user: 'needs_help'.

When this is selected for the current user, help documentation will be 
injected into the Radiant interface. This requires that application_theme be installed.
See http://github.com/saturnflyer/radiant-application_theme-extension/tree/master

Tag radiant069 (f71b1a102f3a81a90f30c06118c9e07604fec544) is the last version compatible
with Radiant version 0.6.9

See HELP_admin.md and HELP_developer.md for more details.
