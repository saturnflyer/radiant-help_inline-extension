With Help Inline you can create extensions that will appear if a user 
has selected the 'Inline Help' preference.

You may add similarly styled tips of your own by adding the class `help_tip`
to any `div` that you add to the interface.

You may also add `render :partial => 'admin/help/help_tip_controls'` to
provide users a link to turn off the help.
